# Taxi_Fare-_Prediction
This project aims to predict the fare of a taxi ride in New York City, given the pickup and dropoff locations.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the "New York City Taxi Fare Prediction" dataset from Kaggle. It contains approximately 55 million records of taxi trips with information such as pickup and dropoff times, locations, passenger counts, and fare amounts.

Requirements
Python 3.6 or higher
Jupyter Notebook
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
matplotlib
seaborn
Running the Project
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Download the dataset from Kaggle and place it in the same directory as the notebook.
Open the Jupyter Notebook and run each cell in order.
The final output will be the predicted fare amount for a given set of pickup and dropoff locations.
Methodology
The project uses a simple linear regression algorithm to predict the fare amount based on the pickup and dropoff locations. The algorithm is trained on a subset of the dataset, and then tested on a separate validation set to evaluate its performance.

Results
The model achieved a root mean squared error (RMSE) of $4.32 on the validation set, indicating good predictive accuracy. However, further improvements could be made by incorporating additional features such as time of day, weather conditions, and traffic congestion.
